# GCIDE sourcing module

There is a list of open access dictionaries known as the WikiMID project.

[GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English(GCIDE)](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dictionarymid/DictionaryForMIDs_GCIDE_EngDef.zip?download) 
is one of the dictionaries available on it.

The module intends to use the CSV extracts from it's JAR and store it into a Postgres table, for further actions.

Table names start with gcide_*.
